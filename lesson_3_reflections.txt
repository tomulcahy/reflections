When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    To provide an online back-up or to share repos with others

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    To have control over what is stored on my local machine.  What I have locally maybe more up-to-date than the remote or vice versa.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    A fork is a clone on GitHub.
    Clones are copies of repositories.
    Branches are labels used to describe a commit that runs parallel to another commit.  The branch has a common ancestor with the master.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    To allow a roll-back to an earlier state if you're offline.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

    By using shared network resources or email.  This is easier to do if you're working with someone who doesn't know git.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?

    If a branch is going to be maintained as a concurrent version of the master.
